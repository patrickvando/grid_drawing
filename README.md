## About

Grid drawing involves using a grid as a visual aid for reproducing an image by hand. Practicing grid drawing is supposed to improve your accuracy and sense of proportion.

This tool provides an easy and convenient way to practice grid drawing. Upload an image of your choice, then use the slider to change the size of the grid, or click and drag with your mouse to change the placement of the grid. Hit the `print` button to have both the image with the grid overlayed and the blank grid printed onto two separate pages.
